# knowledge_retriever

A simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to parse a PDF document, chunk its contents, store the embeddings in FAISS, and query it using a Gemini model.

## Project Structure
* Place your target PDF file in the root directory of the project.

* Ensure an empty folder named data/ is created to store processed data.

## Development Setup

### 1. Create virtual environment

```shell
python3.11 -m venv envname
source envname/bin/activate  # or `envname\Scripts\activate` on Windows
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install Pre-commit
```shell
pre-commit install
```

## Usage
### 1. Prepare the environment

Create a `data` directory in the root folder to store parsed and chunked documents.

```shell
mkdir data
```

### 2. Parse and chunk the PDF

This step processes the PDF, splits its content into manageable chunks, and stores the embeddings in a FAISS vector store.

```shell
python services/pdf_parser.py
```

### 3. Query the document

Edit the `rag_pipeline.py` file to include your query, then run the module to get results generated by the Gemini model.

```shell
python services/rag_pipeline.py
```

### Notes
* Ensure your Gemini API key is configured properly.
